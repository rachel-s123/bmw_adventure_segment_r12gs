# Executive Summary: Norway

## Attribute Resonance
- Off-road performance is paramount with WRI 93.5, driven by Norway's extensive gravel roads and mountainous terrain requiring genuine capability
- Engine character and performance scores WRI 88.5, reflecting strong preference for "soul" and "roar" of petrol engines over electric alternatives
- Heritage/retro styling achieves WRI 84.0, indicating significant appetite for classic aesthetics combined with modern performance capabilities

## Market Insights
- 75% positive sentiment driven by enthusiasm for adventure riding and satisfaction with off-road capabilities in Norway's challenging terrain
- Strong resistance to electric motorcycles despite government incentives, with only 1.2% of Norway's 200,000-bike fleet being electric
- Market exhibits dual preference for modern technology and traditional engine character, seeking advanced features that don't detract from raw riding experience

## Competitor Analysis
- BMW GS Series (traditional) leads with 28.0% share of voice, recognized for touring comfort and advanced technology but perceived as increasingly large for pure off-road use
- KTM 890 Adventure R holds 22.0% share, praised for aggressive off-road performance and lighter weight but faces reliability concerns
- Heritage positioning opportunity exists as competitors focus on either pure performance (KTM) or touring luxury (traditional GS) without authentic heritage storytelling

## Strategic Recommendations
- **Strategic Positioning:** Position R 12 G/S as authentic heritage-modern adventure brand offering "puristic off-road fun" with distinctive boxer engine character
- **Content & Messaging:** Emphasize genuine off-road capability, heritage connection to R 80 G/S, and boxer engine's unique "soul" as core differentiators
- **Audience Targeting:** Focus on heritage enthusiasts, off-road purists, Norwegian terrain specialists, and petrol engine advocates who resist electric alternatives
- **Key Opportunity:** Fill heritage-modern positioning gap while specializing in Norwegian terrain demands through genuine off-road capability and distinctive engine character
