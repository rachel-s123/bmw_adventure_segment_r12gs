    "keyInsights": {
      "Heritage Positioning Reception": "The retro design and homage to the R80 G/S resonated deeply with the target audience. Riders praised the looks more than any other aspect – visual appeal is the R 12 G/S's strongest selling point. The classic color scheme and minimalist, old-school aesthetic elicited an emotional response, especially from long-time BMW fans.",
      "Price Sensitivity Analysis": "At ~€18k in Italy, the R 12 G/S is viewed as expensive, but not outrageously so for a BMW. There's a split: BMW loyalists feel the price is standard/premium but expected, whereas others feel it's too high for the specs. BMW has priced the R12 G/S at the upper limit of what many in the heritage segment are willing to pay.",
      "Feature Expectations vs Reality": "Given its heritage angle, the R 12 G/S has a deliberately simpler feature set than high-end GS models. The bike omits some modern conveniences – notably, it lacks a fuel level gauge on the basic dash. The small 15.5 L tank was widely criticized as limiting range and undermining its \"adventure\" mission.",
      "Adventure Community Acceptance": "Despite the \"enduro\" branding, many hardcore off-road adventurers remain unconvinced that the R 12 G/S is a true dirt machine. The sentiment \"it's still a big pig\" (in off-road context) was echoed in various forms. Riders comparing it to KTM/Husky midweights and the DesertX generally concluded the R12 G/S will be outperformed in rough terrain.",
      "Purchase Decision Factors": "A significant portion of interest comes from existing GS/GSA owners who see the R 12 G/S as a fun addition rather than a replacement. Many discussions essentially boiled down to heart vs head. The heart (emotional appeal) is driving interest, while the head (rational comparison) sometimes pumps the brakes."
