# Debug API Key Detection

## 🔍 **Current Issue**
The AI insights are still showing demo mode, which means the API key isn't being detected properly.

## 🛠️ **Debugging Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Browser Console**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for these debug messages:
   - `🔍 AI Insights Service - API Key Detection:`
   - `🔍 R12GSConsumerAnalysis - Environment Check:`

### **Step 2: Test API Key Detection**
1. Navigate to the R12GSConsumerAnalysis dashboard
2. Look for the "Test API Key Detection" button (if available)
3. Click it and check the console output

### **Step 3: Verify .env File**
The `.env` file should contain:
```bash
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...REDACTED...
```

### **Step 4: Hard Refresh**
1. Stop the development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart the server: `npm start`
4. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## 🔧 **What to Look For**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- Console shows `🤖 Running with REAL AI - API key detected`
- No "Demo Mode" banner in the UI
- API key detection shows `✅ Found`

### **❌ Problem Indicators:**
- Console shows `🎭 Running in DEMO MODE - no API key detected`
- Yellow "Demo Mode" banner appears
- API key detection shows `❌ Not found`

## 🚨 **Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: Environment Variable Not Loading**
**Symptoms:** API key shows as "Not found"
**Solution:** 
- Ensure `.env` file is in project root
- Restart development server completely

### **Issue 2: React Not Picking Up Changes**
**Symptoms:** Changes to `.env` don't reflect
**Solution:**
